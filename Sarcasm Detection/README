Sentiment analysis is often used in NLP to understand people’s subjective opinions. However, the analysis results may
be biased if people use sarcasm in their statements. Therefore,to correctly understand people’s true intention, being
able to detect sarcasm is crucial. In this project we propose to detect sarcasm in textual data. Sarcasm, especially, is key
for sentiment analysis as it can completely flip the polarity of opinions.
